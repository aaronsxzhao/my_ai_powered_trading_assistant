Only avoided F due to correct daily trend ID and discipline to exit with small profit vs large loss.",

Entering at 74.75 in the middle of the 73.75-75.30 range with a 286-tick stop created terrible 1:0.35 risk/reward math, and taking a 10-tick profit after 3h46m showed a scalp/swing identity crisis. For the next 20 trades: (1) Skip barbwire entirely - wait for clear breakouts, (2) Only short at top 30% of ranges, and (3) Match stop size to timeframe (5m = max 90 ticks) or switch to higher timeframe charts. Your trend analysis is sound, but entry selection and execution discipline need major work."
