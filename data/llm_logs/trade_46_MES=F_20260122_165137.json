However, entry was late after 5 consecutive bull bars, signal bar had extremely low volume (exhaustion), trader misidentified bar 36 as bear when it was bull, and location was marginal in middle of range 20 points from magnet. Succeeded despite flaws because overall context was bullish and trader held for swing - a 'got lucky' trade that worked but violated Brooks principles about late entries and ignoring volume warnings.",
    "coaching_summary": "You bought the fifth consecutive bull bar after an 11.75-point spike, ignoring the signal bar's extremely low volume (2 contracts vs 16-31 prior) - classic exhaustion. Brooks: 'Best trades are first and second entries, not the fifth push.' You also misidentified bar 36 as bear when actually bull, showing rushed analysis. Trade worked because you were with Always-In and held for 2.96R, but you got lucky. Next time: count consecutive bars and check volume - after more than 3 bars or volume below 50% average, wait for deeper pullback or skip."
