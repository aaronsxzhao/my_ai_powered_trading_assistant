    "coaching_summary": "You shorted the 3rd push of a wedge bottom at the low of a 2-hour trading range - a double violation of Brooks principles. Wedge bottoms are BULLISH reversal patterns, and you should buy low in ranges, not sell low. Your signal bar was strong, but context trumps signal bar quality. The trade made money only because you took quick profit before the likely wedge reversal occurred. Next time, before shorting a 'second entry,' count the pushes - if it's the 3rd push down with converging highs, that's a wedge bottom and you should be looking to BUY, not sell."
