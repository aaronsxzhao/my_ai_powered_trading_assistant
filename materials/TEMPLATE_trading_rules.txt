# MY TRADING RULES & METHODOLOGY
# ================================
# Delete this template and replace with your own rules.
# Keep this file focused (~5-20KB is ideal for AI context).
# The AI will use this to analyze your trades.

## SETUPS I TRADE
# List the specific setups you trade with your definitions

### With-Trend Setups:
- High/Low 1, 2, 3: Pullback entries after trend bars
- Breakout Pullback (BP): First pullback after a breakout
- Wedge Bull/Bear Flag: Three-push pullback in a trend

### Countertrend Setups:
- Major Trend Reversal (MTR): Need strong reversal bar + break of trendline + test
- Wedge Reversal: Three-push climax pattern
- Double Bottom/Top: At key support/resistance

### Trading Range Setups:
- Failed Breakout: Fade moves to range extremes
- Second Entry at Range Boundary: Wait for failed breakout first


## MY ENTRY RULES
# When do I enter?

1. Only enter when I have a clear stop location
2. Need 2:1 minimum reward-to-risk for scalps
3. With-trend trades: Stop below signal bar low
4. Counter-trend: Need multiple confirming factors


## MY EXIT RULES
# When do I exit?

1. First target at measured move or prior swing
2. Trail stop below prior swing in trends
3. Exit at first sign of reversal in trading ranges


## POSITION SIZING
# How much do I risk?

- Risk 1% of account per trade
- Reduce size in choppy markets
- Never add to losers


## MY COMMON MISTAKES
# What do I need to watch for?

1. Trading in the middle of ranges
2. Fighting strong trends
3. Not waiting for second entries
4. Moving stops to breakeven too early


## MARKET CONTEXT RULES
# How do I read the market?

- Always identify daily chart structure first
- Know if we're in trend or trading range
- Know the always-in direction
- Check prior day's high, low, close


## NOTES FROM AL BROOKS
# Key concepts I want the AI to apply

- "The trend is your friend until it ends"
- Wait for second entries in trading ranges
- First breakout usually fails in trading range
- 80% of reversals fail - trade with the trend
- Signal bars need follow-through
